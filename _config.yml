my name is Aymane Amine and I am completing a Msc degree in stochastics and dynamical systems at the university of Vienna, where I have already finished a bachelor degree <br>
with a thesis titled “Distribution, Fourier transform and the Wave equation” under the supervision of Professor Roland Donninger. I expect to be finished this upcoming January. <br>
During my studies, I developed an immense interest in Analysis, Geometry, Probability theory as well as PDE´s.  In my master thesis under supervision of Julio Backhoff and Abdol-Reza Mansouri from Queens university.<br> 
I am investigating problems at the intersection of the fields of (Continuous Martingale) optimal transport, Geometry and Stochastic Analysis.   <br>
