## Portfolio

I am a PhD student at the Center for Data Science at NYU and a DeepMind fellow, advised by Professor Andrew Gordon Wilson. I am currently interested in designing robust models that can generalize well in and out of distribution. I also work on the closely related question of understanding and quantifying the generalization properties of deep neural networks. More broadly, my research interests include probabilistic modeling, Bayesian learning, large-scale optimization, and loss surface analysis.

Prior to NYU, I obtained a master’s degree in applied mathematics from Polytechnique Montreal. I was fortunate to work there with Professors Andrea Lodi and Dominique Orban to design stochastic first- and second-order algorithms with compelling theoretical and empirical properties for machine learning and large-scale optimization. I received the Best Master's Thesis Award in Applied Mathematics for this work.

I also hold an engineering degree in general engineering and applied mathematics from CentraleSupélec.

In summer 2022, I am excited to work with Bernie Wang and Richard Kurle at Amazon as an Applied Scientist Intern.
